\title{Late Integration of Penalized Regression Models Across Multiple Omics Layers}
\usage{
L_pen_regression_models(
  mae,
  omic_list,
  surv_list,
  method = "RRA",
  model = c("cox_lasso", "cox_adaptive_lasso", "cox_elastic_net", "aft_pen"),
  train_fraction = 0.7,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mae}{A MultiAssayExperiment object containing multiple omics datasets and
clinical information. Results will be stored in
\code{metadata(mae)$analysis$late_integration}.}

\item{omic_list}{A list of omics layer names (or SummarizedExperiment objects)
corresponding to assays in the MAE. Each will be modeled independently. Common
samples across all layers are automatically identified and used.}

\item{surv_list}{A specification for extracting survival data from the MAE,
typically containing column names for time and event variables. Passed to
\code{prepare_surv_data}.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the late integration method for combining
predictions across omics layers. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"average"}: Simple or weighted average of risk scores
\item \code{"RRA"}: Robust Rank Aggregation, combines rankings rather than raw scores (default)
}
Default is \code{"average"}.}

\item{model}{Character string specifying the penalized regression model to fit
on each omics layer. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cox_lasso"}: Cox regression with Lasso penalty
\item \code{"cox_adaptive_lasso"}: Cox regression with adaptive Lasso penalty
\item \code{"cox_elastic_net"}: Cox regression with elastic net penalty
\item \code{"aft_pen"}: Accelerated Failure Time model with elastic net or grouped lasso penalties
}
Default is \code{"cox_lasso"}.}

\item{train_fraction}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion of
samples to use for training. The remainder is used for testing. Default is 0.7
(70\\% train, 30\\% test).}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility of the train/test split. Default is 123.
The same seed ensures identical splits across all omics layers.}
}
\value{
The input MultiAssayExperiment object with updated metadata. Results are
stored at \code{metadata(mae)$analysis$late_integration[[model]]} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{train}: Late integration results on training data, including:
\itemize{
\item Ensemble predictions (combined risk scores)
\item Ensemble C-index
\item Individual omics-specific predictions and C-indices
\item Integration method used
}
\item \code{test}: Late integration results on test data with the same structure
}
Additionally, individual omics results are stored at:
\code{metadata(mae)$analysis[[model]][[omic_name]]}
}
\description{
Performs late integration of survival predictions from penalized regression
models trained independently on each omics layer. Each omics dataset is modeled
separately using the same train/test split, and predictions are combined using
averaging or rank-based aggregation methods.
}
\details{
The function implements a late integration (late fusion) workflow:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies common samples across all omics layers
\item Creates a single reference train/test split based on the first omics layer
\item Applies the same split to all other omics layers (ensures consistency)
\item Trains the specified penalized model independently on each omics layer
\item Combines predictions from all layers using the specified integration method
\item Evaluates ensemble performance on both training and test sets
\item Stores individual and ensemble results in MAE metadata
}
}
\section{Integration Methods}{

\describe{
\item{average}{Combines risk scores by averaging. Can be simple mean or weighted
based on layer-specific performance. Assumes risk scores are on comparable scales.}
\item{RRA}{Robust Rank Aggregation converts predictions to ranks within each layer,
then combines ranks. More robust to outliers and scale differences. Useful when
absolute risk scores vary widely across layers.}
}
}

\section{Result Organization}{

Results are stored hierarchically:
