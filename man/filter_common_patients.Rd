\title{Filter Omics Data to Retain Only Common Samples Across All Layers}
\usage{
filter_common_patients(omics_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{omics_list}{A list of omics data objects (typically SummarizedExperiment objects
or matrices) where:
\itemize{
\item Each element represents a different omics layer (e.g., transcriptomics,
proteomics, methylation)
\item Samples are represented as columns
\item Column names contain sample identifiers that should be consistent across layers
}}
}
\value{
A list of the same length and structure as \code{omics_list}, where each
element has been subset to include only the common samples. The order of samples
(columns) is consistent across all returned omics layers. Sample order follows
the intersection order determined by \code{Reduce(intersect, ...)}.
}
\description{
Identifies and retains only samples (patients) that are present across all omics
datasets. This ensures complete multi-omics profiles for downstream integrative
analysis by removing samples with missing data in any omics layer.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\enumerate{
\item Extracts column names (sample IDs) from each omics layer
\item Identifies samples present in ALL layers using set intersection
\item Subsets each omics object to retain only common samples
\item Preserves the original data structure and class of each omics layer
}

This filtering step is essential for multi-omics integration because:
\itemize{
\item Many integration methods require complete data across all modalities
\item It prevents errors from sample mismatches during analysis
\item It ensures fair comparison across omics layers
\item It identifies the cohort with comprehensive multi-omics profiling
}

The function will stop with an error if no samples are common across all layers,
which may indicate:
\itemize{
\item Inconsistent sample naming conventions
\item Non-overlapping patient cohorts
}
}
