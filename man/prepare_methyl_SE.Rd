\title{Prepare Methylation Data as SummarizedExperiment}
\usage{
prepare_methyl_SE(
  methyl_data,
  clinical_data,
  system_type = "unix",
  method = NULL,
  p_threshold = 0.1,
  iqr_threshold = 0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{methyl_data}{Numeric matrix of methylation data (genes/CpG sites as rows,
samples as columns).}

\item{clinical_data}{Matrix or data frame of clinical data (variables as rows,
samples as columns). Must include "overall_survival" and "status" rows for
supervised selection.}

\item{system_type}{Character string specifying OS type ("unix" or other). Currently
unused; parallel backend auto-detected from platform.}

\item{method}{Character string for feature selection: \code{"supervised"} (Cox
regression-based), \code{"unsupervised"} (IQR-based), or \code{NULL} (no selection).
Default is NULL.}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric p-value threshold for supervised selection. Default is 0.1.}

\item{iqr_threshold}{Numeric proportion (0-1) of top IQR genes to retain for
unsupervised selection. Default is 0.25.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with:
\itemize{
\item \code{assays$counts}: Filtered methylation matrix
\item \code{metadata$preprocessing}: List with \code{omics = "methylation"}
and \code{method} used
}
}
\description{
Processes methylation data by aligning samples with clinical data, removing
incomplete cases, and optionally performing supervised or unsupervised feature
selection.
