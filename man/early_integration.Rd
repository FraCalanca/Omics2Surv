\title{Early Integration of Multiple Omics Layers}
\usage{
early_integration(mae, omics_names, new_layer_name = "early_integrated")
}
\arguments{
\item{mae}{A MultiAssayExperiment object containing multiple omics experiments.}

\item{omics_names}{Character vector specifying the names of omics experiments to
integrate. Must match experiment names in \code{names(mae)}. Typically includes
2-3 layers such as \code{c("transcriptomics", "proteomics", "methylation")}.}

\item{new_layer_name}{Character string specifying the name for the new integrated
assay that will be added to the MAE. Default is \code{"early_integrated"}.}
}
\value{
A MultiAssayExperiment object containing:
\itemize{
\item All original omics experiments from the input MAE (subset to common samples)
\item A new experiment named \code{new_layer_name} containing the integrated
feature matrix
}
The integrated experiment is a SummarizedExperiment with:
\itemize{
\item Rows: All features from all omics layers (concatenated)
\item Columns: Samples common across all specified omics layers
\item Row names: Prefixed with omics layer name (e.g., "transcriptomics_GENE1")
}
}
\description{
Performs early integration (early fusion) of multiple omics datasets by concatenating
feature matrices into a single unified matrix. All omics layers are combined before
any modeling, creating a comprehensive feature space that includes all measured
molecular variables.
}
\details{
The early integration workflow consists of:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Sample alignment}: Identifies and retains only samples present in
ALL specified omics layers using \code{intersectColumns()}
\item \strong{Feature concatenation}:
\itemize{
\item Extracts feature matrix from each omics layer
\item Prefixes row names with omics layer identifier to ensure uniqueness
\item Concatenates all matrices by rows (vertical stacking)
}
\item \strong{SummarizedExperiment creation}: Packages the combined matrix into
a SummarizedExperiment object
\item \strong{MAE integration}: Adds the integrated layer to the original MAE
while preserving all original experiments
}
