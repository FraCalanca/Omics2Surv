\title{Test Cooperative Learning Model}
\usage{
test_cooplearning(X_list_test, y_test, training_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_list_test}{A named list of omics data matrices or data frames for testing.
Must contain the same omics layers (in the same order and with matching feature names)
as used in training. Each element should have:
\itemize{
\item Samples as rows with matching row names across all omics layers
\item Features as columns, matching those in the training data
}}

\item{y_test}{A data frame containing test survival outcomes with:
\itemize{
\item Row names matching sample identifiers in \code{X_list_test}
\item Column \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item Column \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}}

\item{training_result}{A list object returned by \code{\link{train_cooplearning}}
containing the trained model and coefficients.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pred}{Numeric vector of risk scores for test samples. Higher values indicate
higher risk (shorter predicted survival). Calculated as the linear combination
of features weighted by learned coefficients.}
\item{cindex}{Numeric concordance index (C-index) on test data. Values range from
0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates random predictions and 1.0 indicates perfect concordance.
Calculated with \code{reverse = TRUE} to account for risk score directionality.}
}
\description{
Evaluates a trained cooperative learning model on test data by generating risk
predictions and calculating the concordance index.
}
\details{
This function applies the trained cooperative learning model to new test data:
\enumerate{
\item Validates that \code{X_list_test} is a list
\item Aligns test samples across all omics layers using common identifiers
\item Combines all omics layers into a single feature matrix
\item Ensures feature names match the training model
\item Computes risk scores as a weighted sum: \code{X_test \%*\% coefficients}
\item Calculates C-index to evaluate prediction performance
}

The C-index measures the model's discriminative ability—the probability that,
for a randomly selected pair of patients, the model correctly ranks which patient
will experience the event first.
}
\section{Data Requirements}{

\itemize{
\item Test omics layers must match training layers in number, order, and features
\item Only samples present in all test omics layers are used
\item Feature names must be consistent with training data
}
}
