train_blockForest(
  x_training,

  prefixes = NULL,
  threads = 10,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_training}{A matrix or data frame of training predictors.}

\item{y_training}{A data frame containing survival outcomes with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}}

\item{prefixes}{Character vector of prefixes used to define feature blocks. Each prefix
identifies a group of related variables (e.g., \code{c("clinical_", "omic1_", "omic2_")}).
This parameter is required and must not be NULL.}

\item{threads}{Integer specifying the number of parallel threads to use. Default is 10.}

\item{always.split.variables}{Optional list of variable names that should be considered
at every split. Useful for forcing important clinical variables to be evaluated.
Must be a list; set to NULL to disable. Default is NULL.}

\item{n_top_genes}{Integer specifying the number of top important features to select
based on variable importance. Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility. Default is 8240.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{model}{The trained blockForest model object.}
\item{cindex}{Numeric training concordance index (C-index), calculated as 1 - prediction error.}
\item{pred}{Numeric vector of linear predictors (prognostic scores) for training samples,
extracted from the cumulative hazard function.}
\item{selected_features}{Character vector of the top N most important features based on
impurity-based variable importance, where N = \code{n_top_genes}.}
\item{extra}{List containing additional information:
\itemize{
\item \code{variable_importance}: Named numeric vector of importance scores for all features
\item \code{blocks}: List of feature block indices as defined by prefixes
}}
}
\description{
Trains a block random forest model for survival data using the blockForest algorithm.
Features are organized into blocks based on specified prefixes (e.g., clinical, genomic, transcriptomic),
allowing for structured variable selection and importance ranking.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Organizes features into blocks based on the specified prefixes
\item Calculates block-specific mtry values using the square root rule: \code{sqrt(block_size)}
\item Trains a survival random forest using the logrank splitting rule
\item Computes variable importance using impurity reduction
\item Extracts training predictions and performance metrics
\item Selects top important features for downstream analysis
}
