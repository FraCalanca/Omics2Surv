\title{Split Data into Training and Testing Sets}
\usage{
split_train_test(design_matrix, surv_data, seed = 4820, train_fraction = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_matrix}{A matrix or data frame of predictor variables (omics data),
where rows represent samples.}

\item{surv_data}{A matrix or data frame containing survival outcomes,
with row names matching \code{design_matrix}.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility.
Default is 4820.}

\item{train_fraction}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the
proportion of samples to include in the training set.}
}
\value{
A named list containing four elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{train_omic}: Training subset of the design matrix.
\item \code{test_omic}: Testing subset of the design matrix.
\item \code{train_survival}: Training subset of the survival data.
\item \code{test_survival}: Testing subset of the survival data.
}
}
\description{
Randomly partitions a design matrix and corresponding survival data into
training and testing subsets based on a specified proportion.
