\title{Late Integration of Multi-Omics Survival Predictions}
\usage{
late_integration(
  res_list,
  y,
  model = c("cox_lasso", "cox_adaptive_lasso", "cox_elastic_net", "aft_pen"),
  method = c("average", "RRA")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res_list}{A named list where each element contains results from a single
omics layer model. Each element must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{pred}: Numeric vector of risk predictions for samples
}
List names typically represent omics layers (e.g., "transcriptomics", "proteomics").}

\item{y}{A data frame containing survival outcomes with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}
Row names should correspond to patient/sample identifiers.}

\item{model}{Character string specifying the underlying prediction model type.
Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cox_lasso"}: Cox Lasso regression
\item \code{"cox_adaptive_lasso"}: Adaptive Cox Lasso
\item \code{"cox_elastic_net"}: Cox elastic net
\item \code{"aft_pen"}: Penalized Accelerated Failure Time model
}}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the integration method. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"average"}: Average of normalized ranks across omics layers
\item \code{"RRA"}: Robust Rank Aggregation using the RobustRankAggreg package
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pred}{Numeric vector of consensus risk ranks for all patients. Lower ranks
indicate lower risk (longer predicted survival). Length equals number of patients.}
\item{merged_risks}{Data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{patient_id}: Sample identifiers
\item \code{risk_omics1}, \code{risk_omics2}, ...: Original risk scores from each omics layer
\item \code{norm_omics1}, \code{norm_omics2}, ...: Z-score normalized risk scores
\item \code{rank_omics1}, \code{rank_omics2}, ...: Ranks of normalized scores within each layer
\item \code{consensus_rank}: Final integrated consensus rank
}}
\item{cindex}{Numeric concordance index (C-index) evaluating the consensus predictions
against the observed survival outcomes.}
}
\description{
Combines risk predictions from multiple independently-trained omics models into
a single consensus prediction. Supports averaging of normalized ranks or Robust
Rank Aggregation (RRA) to create an ensemble prediction that leverages information
from all omics layers.
}
\details{
The late integration workflow consists of the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Extract}: Collect risk scores from each omics layer model
\item \strong{Merge}: Combine risk scores into a single data frame by patient ID
\item \strong{Normalize}: Z-score standardize risk scores within each omics layer
(mean = 0, SD = 1) to make them comparable across layers
\item \strong{Rank}: Convert normalized scores to ranks within each layer using
average method for ties
\item \strong{Integrate}: Combine ranks across layers:
\itemize{
\item \code{average}: Simple arithmetic mean of ranks
\item \code{RRA}: Statistical aggregation accounting for rank distribution
}
\item \strong{Evaluate}: Calculate C-index of consensus predictions
}
