\title{Prepare mRNA Expression Data as SummarizedExperiment}
\usage{
prepare_mRNA_SE(
  RNA_data,
  clinical_data,
  q_threshold = 0.25,
  method = NULL,
  p_threshold = 0.1,
  hvg_threshold = 25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{RNA_data}{Numeric matrix of mRNA expression data (genes as rows, samples
as columns).}

\item{clinical_data}{Matrix or data frame of clinical data (variables as rows,
samples as columns). Must include "overall_survival" and "status" rows for
supervised selection.}

\item{q_threshold}{Numeric quantile threshold (0-1) for low expression filtering.
Genes with expression at this quantile equal to 0 are removed. Default is 0.25.}

\item{method}{Character string for feature selection: \code{"supervised"} (Cox
regression-based), \code{"unsupervised"} (high variable genes), or \code{NULL}
(no selection). Default is NULL.}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric p-value threshold for supervised selection. Default is 0.1.}

\item{hvg_threshold}{Numeric percentile (0-100) for highly variable gene selection
in unsupervised method. Default is 25 (top 25\% most variable genes).}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with:
\itemize{
\item \code{assays$counts}: Filtered mRNA expression matrix
\item \code{metadata$preprocessing}: List with \code{omics = "mRNA"} and
\code{method} used
}
}
\description{
Processes mRNA expression data by aligning samples with clinical data, removing
genes with missing values or low expression, and optionally performing supervised
or unsupervised feature selection.
