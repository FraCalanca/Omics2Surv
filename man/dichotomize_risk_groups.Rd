\title{Dichotomize Continuous Risk Scores into High and Low Risk Groups}
\usage{
dichotomize_risk_groups(
  pred_train,
  pred_test,
  method = "median",
  custom_cutoff = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred_train}{Numeric vector of risk predictions from the training set.
Used to determine the cutoff threshold. NA values are removed when calculating
median cutoffs.}

\item{pred_test}{Numeric vector of risk predictions from the test set (or any
dataset to be stratified). These predictions will be classified as High or Low
risk based on the cutoff derived from \code{pred_train}.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the method to determine the cutoff threshold.
Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"median"}: Use the median of training predictions
\item \code{"custom"}: Use a user-specified cutoff value (requires \code{custom_cutoff})
}
Default is \code{"median"}.}

\item{custom_cutoff}{Numeric value specifying a custom cutoff threshold. Only used
when \code{method = "custom"}. Must be provided if custom method is selected.
Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{groups}{Factor vector with two levels (\code{"Low"}, \code{"High"}) indicating
risk group assignment for each sample in \code{pred_test}. Samples with predictions
above the cutoff are classified as "High" risk; those at or below are "Low" risk.}
\item{cutoff}{Numeric value of the threshold used for dichotomization. This allows
users to see the exact cutoff applied and use it consistently across multiple datasets.}
}
\description{
Converts continuous risk predictions into binary risk groups (High/Low) based on
a cutoff threshold. The cutoff can be determined from training data using median,
or a custom value, and is then applied to test data for risk stratification.
}
\details{
This function is commonly used in survival analysis to:
\itemize{
\item Stratify patients into risk groups for Kaplan-Meier analysis
\item Create interpretable clinical risk categories from continuous scores
\item Enable comparison of survival curves between high and low risk groups
\item Facilitate risk-based treatment decision making
}

Classification logic:
\itemize{
\item \code{pred_test > cutoff} → "High" risk
\item \code{pred_test <= cutoff} → "Low" risk
}
}
\section{Cutoff Methods}{

\describe{
\item{Median}{Robust to outliers; splits training samples into equal-sized groups.}
\item{Custom}{Allows domain-specific thresholds based on clinical relevance,
prior studies, or optimization criteria.}
}
