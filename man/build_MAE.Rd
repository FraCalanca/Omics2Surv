\title{Build a MultiAssayExperiment Object from Omics Data}
\usage{
build_MAE(omics_list, clinical_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{omics_list}{A named list of SummarizedExperiment objects, where each element
represents a different omics dataset (e.g., gene expression, methylation, proteomics).
All elements must be valid SummarizedExperiment objects. List names will be used
as experiment identifiers in the resulting MAE.}

\item{clinical_data}{A matrix or data frame of clinical/phenotypic data where:
\itemize{
\item Rows represent different clinical variables (features)
\item Columns represent samples
\item Column names should match sample identifiers across omics datasets
}
This will be transposed internally so that rows represent samples in the final MAE.}
}
\value{
A MultiAssayExperiment object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{experiments}: The omics datasets from \code{omics_list}
\item \code{colData}: Transposed and type-converted clinical data as a DataFrame,
where rows represent samples and columns represent clinical variables
\item Coordinated sample mapping across all experiments
}
}
\description{
Constructs a MultiAssayExperiment (MAE) container that integrates multiple omics
datasets with associated clinical/phenotypic data. This unified data structure
facilitates multi-omics analysis and ensures coordinated sample management across
different data types.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\enumerate{
\item Validates that all elements in \code{omics_list} are SummarizedExperiment objects
\item Transposes \code{clinical_data} so samples are in rows (standard MAE format)
\item Preserves sample identifiers from rownames after transposition
\item Automatically converts column types using \code{type.convert} (e.g., strings to factors,
numeric strings to numbers) with \code{as.is = FALSE}
\item Constructs the MultiAssayExperiment with proper S4 DataFrame structure
\item Prints a confirmation message with the number of omics datasets included
}

The resulting MAE object enables:
\itemize{
\item Unified access to multiple omics layers
\item Automatic subsetting across all experiments
\item Integration with Bioconductor workflows
\item Sample-level metadata management
}
}
\section{Data Structure Requirements}{

\itemize{
\item Each SummarizedExperiment in \code{omics_list} should have sample identifiers
as column names (in \code{colData})
\item Clinical data column names should correspond to these sample identifiers
\item Sample matching across experiments is handled automatically by MAE
}
