\title{Test Block Random Forest Model}
\usage{
test_blockForest(x_test, y_test, training_result, num_threads = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_test}{A matrix or data frame of test predictors. Must have the same
features (columns) as \code{x_training} used in training, including matching
column names and prefixes.}

\item{y_test}{A data frame containing test survival outcomes with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}}

\item{training_result}{A list object returned by \code{\link{train_blockForest}}
containing the trained model and associated parameters. Note: The function
expects \code{training_result$model_BF}, but \code{train_blockForest} returns
\code{training_result$model}. Ensure compatibility or adjust accordingly.}

\item{num_threads}{Integer specifying the number of parallel threads to use for
prediction. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pred}{Numeric vector of linear predictors (risk scores) for test samples,
extracted from the final column of the cumulative hazard function (CHF).
Higher values indicate higher risk (shorter predicted survival).}
\item{cindex}{Numeric concordance index (C-index) on test data. Values range from
0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates random predictions and 1.0 indicates perfect concordance.
Calculated with \code{reverse = TRUE} to account for risk score directionality.}
}
\description{
Evaluates a trained block random forest model on test data by generating risk
predictions and calculating the concordance index.
}
\details{
This function applies the trained block random forest model to new test data:
\enumerate{
\item Prepares test data in the same format as training data
\item Generates predictions using the trained model
\item Extracts risk scores from the cumulative hazard function (CHF)
\item Calculates the concordance index to evaluate prediction accuracy
}
}
