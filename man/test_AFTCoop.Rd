\title{Test AFT Cooperative Learning Model}
\usage{
test_AFTCoop(x_test1, x_test2, y_test, training_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_test1}{A matrix or data frame of the first set of test predictors.
Must have the same features (columns) as \code{x_training1} used in training.}

\item{x_test2}{A matrix or data frame of the second set of test predictors.
Must have the same features (columns) as \code{x_training2} used in training.}

\item{y_test}{A data frame containing test survival outcomes with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}}

\item{training_result}{A list object returned by \code{\link{train_AFTCoop}}
containing the trained model coefficients and parameters.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pred}{Named list of test set predictions for each rho value.
Higher predicted values indicate higher risk (shorter predicted survival).}
\item{cindex}{Named list of concordance indices (C-index) on test data for each rho value.
Values range from 0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates random predictions and 1.0 indicates
perfect concordance.}
}
\description{
Evaluates a trained AFT cooperative learning model on test data by generating
predictions and calculating concordance indices for each rho value.
}
\details{
This function applies the coefficients learned during training to new test data.
For each rho value in the trained model:
\enumerate{
\item Extracts the corresponding coefficient vector
\item Generates risk predictions using \code{predict_aft_coop}
\item Calculates the concordance index (C-index) comparing predictions to actual outcomes
}
}
