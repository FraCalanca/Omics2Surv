\usage{
train_cooplearning(
  X_list,
  y_training,
  lambdaVector = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1),
  folds = 5,
  alpha = 1,
  maxit = 100,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_list}{A named list of 2 or 3 omics data matrices or data frames. Each element
represents a different omics layer (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, methylation).
All matrices must have:
\itemize{
\item Samples as rows with matching row names across all omics layers
\item Features as columns
}}

\item{y_training}{A data frame containing survival outcomes with:
\itemize{
\item Row names matching sample identifiers in \code{X_list}
\item Column \code{overall_survival}: Numeric survival time
\item Column \code{status}: Numeric event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored)
}}

\item{lambdaVector}{Numeric vector of lambda values to evaluate during cross-validation.
Default is \code{seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)}. Lambda controls the strength of regularization.}

\item{folds}{Integer specifying the number of cross-validation folds for lambda selection.
Default is 5.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value controlling the agreement between layers.
\code{alpha = 1} for 2 layers, \code{alpha = 0.5} for 3 layers. Default is 1.}

\item{maxit}{Integer maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm.
Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility of train/validation split and cross-validation.
Default is 123.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{model}{The trained cooplasso model object containing coefficient vector \code{b}
and other model parameters.}
\item{selected_lambda}{Numeric optimal lambda value selected through cross-validation.}
\item{selected_features}{Character vector of feature names with non-zero coefficients
(selected features across all omics layers).}
\item{pred}{Numeric vector of risk scores for training samples. Higher values indicate
higher risk (shorter predicted survival).}
\item{cindex}{Numeric concordance index (C-index) on training data, calculated with
\code{reverse = TRUE} to account for risk score directionality.}
\item{omics}{Character vector of omics layer names from the input \code{X_list}.}
}
\description{
Trains a cooperative Lasso (CoopLasso) Cox regression model that integrates
multiple omics datasets for survival prediction. The method encourages cooperation
between different data modalities while performing feature selection through
L1 regularization.
}
\details{
The function performs the following workflow:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input structure (2 or 3 omics layers required)
\item Aligns samples across all omics layers and survival data using common identifiers
\item Splits data into training (90\\%) and validation (10\\%) sets
\item Performs k-fold cross-validation to select optimal lambda parameter
\item Trains final cooperative Lasso model with selected lambda
\item Computes risk scores and C-index on training data
\item Identifies selected features with non-zero coefficients
}
